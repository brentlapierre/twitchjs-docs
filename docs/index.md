# Twitch.js

Twitch.js is a JavaScript library designed to ease the creation of chat bots on Twitch.tv.

## Why Use Twitch.js?
Twitch.js makes development easier by handling everything for you with easy to use commands, while also still giving you the ability to send raw IRC commands if you'd like to.
